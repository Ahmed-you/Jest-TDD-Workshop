# FizzBuzz

Using Test Driven Development to solve FizzBuzz

## Defining the problem

Before we start, and for the ones who are not familiar with the FizzBuzz problem, the idea is to display integers from 1 to 100, but 

- for multiples of 3 we’ll display the word **Fizz** instead of the integer,
- for multiples of 5 we’ll output **Buzz** instead of the integer
- and for multiples of 3 and 5 we’ll display **FizzBuzz**,

an example of the output below:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
```
## Defining the tool

**TDD** is basically a methodology or a software development process that is based on the repetition of the following tasks:

- write a simple test that defines an expected functionality/outcome
- make the test fail (it will fail as we haven’t written any code just yet!)
- write your code as simple as possible to make your test pass
- refactor your code and run the same test again (it should pass as even though is refactored the functionality should be the same.
