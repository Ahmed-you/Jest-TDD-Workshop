# FizzBuzz TDD Workshop

This repository is a learning exercise to understand and apply **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The project is based on the classic **FizzBuzz** problem.

# About TDD
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the code. It follows these steps:
1. Write a test for the feature.
2. Write the minimal code to pass the test.
3. Refactor the code and tests.

# Task Reference
This workshop is inspired by [GSG-G10 FizzBuzz](https://github.com/GSG-G10/fizzbuzz), which introduces TDD through a simple FizzBuzz implementation.

# What is FizzBuzz?
FizzBuzz is a programming challenge that requires the following output:
- Print numbers from 1 to n.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".


# Why I Am Learning TDD?
- TDD ensures your code works as expected before moving forward.
- It reduces bugs in production.
- The methodology improves code quality and maintainability.
